                                XPrompt

XPrompt is a prompt for X.
XPrompt features a text input field where the user can type in a text
subject to tab-completion.

When the user presses Return, the typed text is printed to the stdout.
When the user presses Tab, a dropdown menu appears showing the items
from the stdin that matches the word to be completed.  It can read a
list of newline-separated items from stdin.

XPrompt is conceptually equal to Suckless' dmenu, but they have several
differences.  Namely, the following are features of xprompt that are not
in dmenu:
• Text selection (both via mouse or via Shift+Arrow).
• Configurable keybindings (via the XPROMPTCTRL environment variable).
• History (via the XPROMPTHISTFILE and XPROMPTHISTSIZE environment
  variables).
• Tab-completion with a dropdown list of items.
• Contextual completion (the text to complete depends on what you have
  typed in).
• File name completion (with -f option).
• Each completion item can be followed by a description.
• Configurable size and position (via X resources).
• Configurable colors and fonts (via X resources).


§ Files

The files are:
• ./README:     This file.
• ./Makefile:   The makefile.
• ./demo.gif:   A gif demonstrating how XPrompt works.
• ./config.h:   The hardcoded default configuration for XPrompt.
• ./config.mk:  The setup for the makefile.
• ./xprompt.1:  The manual file (man page) for XPrompt.
• ./xprompt.c:  The source code of XPrompt.


§ Installation

First, edit ./config.mk to match your local setup.

In order to build XPrompt you need the Xlib and Xft header files.
The default configuration for XPrompt is specified in the file config.h,
you can edit it, but most configuration can be changed at runtime via
X resources, environment variables and/or command-line arguments.
Enter the following command to build XPrompt.  This command creates the
binary file ./xprompt.

	make

By default, XPrompt is installed into the /usr/local prefix.  Enter the
following command to install XPrompt (if necessary as root).  This command
installs the binary file ./xprompt into the ${PREFIX}/bin/ directory, and
the manual file ./xprompt.1 into ${MANPREFIX}/man1/ directory.

	make install


§ Running XPrompt

Suppose a file containing the following content, where “\t” means a tab
character.

	git
	\t   add\t    Add file contents to the index.
	\t   rm\t     Remove files from the working tree and from the index.
	\t   mv\t     Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink.
	\t   commit\t Record changes to the repository.
	man
	\t   cat
	\t   cut
	\t   ed
	\t   vi
	open


By passing this file as stdin to xprompt, xprompt will have the
following behavior when pressing Tab.

	If the input field is empty, xprompt will display a dropdown list
	with the following three entries after pressing Tab:
	git, man, and open.

	If the input field contains the word "git" at the beginning of the
	line, xprompt will display a dropdown list with the following four
	entries after pressing Tab:
	add, rm, mv, and commit.
	It will also display the description after each completion.

	If the input field contains the word "man" at the beginning of the
	line, xprompt will display a dropdown list with the following
	four entries after pressing Tab:
	cat, cut, ed, and vi.

	If the input field contains the word open at the beginning of the
	line, and xprompt was invoked with the -f option, then xprompt will
	display a dropdown list with possible filenames after pressing Tab,
	since no completion was specified for the command "open" at stdin.

The file ./demo.gif shows how a xprompt generated by that input looks like.
